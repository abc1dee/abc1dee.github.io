## Scroll Animation Note

**Note!!:** The scroll animation has been disabled for mobile view due to mobile devices not reliably picking up the scroll. The animation works seamlessly on regular desktops, providing an enhanced user experience.

## Overview

This repository contains the code for my awesome website that accomplishes the following:

- **Criteria Achievement:** Discusses how each criteria was accomplished.
- **Class Concepts:** 
    - **HTML:** Building the structure of the website.
    - **CSS Styles and Media Query:** Applying Flex designs, various selectors, and responsive layouts.
    - **JavaScript:** Utilized for the scrolling animation and implementing a hamburger icon exclusively for smaller devices.
- **Design Inspiration:** The design is inspired by my preference for minimalism, presenting a classic black and white look.
- **Content Creation:** The approach to content creation was spontaneous, capturing thoughts as they came to mind.
- **Creativity:** The website embraces creativity with animations and a simple yet impactful design.

## Deployment

The website is deployed using Codespace, Visual Studio Code, and GitHub.

## Learning Insights 

I easily learned and adapted to how markup languages work. Having experience with other languages before, it wasn't as challenging, and I found the concepts to be intuitive and enjoyable.

## Challenges Faced

One notable challenge I faced was in managing my time effectively. Balancing coding with my esports tournament commitments demanded careful planning, but it was a valuable experience in time management.
